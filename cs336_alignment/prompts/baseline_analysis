Problem: Robin bought a four-scoop ice cream cone having a scoop each of vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cherry. In how many orders can the four scoops be stacked on the cone if they are stacked one on top of the other and chocolate cannot be on the bottom?
Ground Truth: 18
Model Output: ' <answer>\n             To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of ways to arrange the four scoops of ice cream on the cone without any restrictions. This is a permutation problem, and since all four scoops are distinct, the number of ways to arrange them is 4! (4 factorial), which equals 24.\n             However, we have an additional constraint: chocolate cannot be on the bottom. There is only one way for chocolate to be on the bottom, so we need to subtract this from the total number of arrangements.\n             Therefore, the number of possible cone varieties is 24 - 1 = 23.\n             </answer>'

Problem: Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a parallelogram. If the measure of angle $A$ is 62 degrees and the measure of angle $ADB$ is 75 degrees, what is the measure of angle $ADC$, in degrees?
Ground Truth: 118^{\circ}
Model Output: ' To find the measure of angle $ADC$, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a parallelogram is 360 degrees. Since angle $A$ is 62 degrees, angle $C$ is also 62 degrees. Angle $ADB$ is 75 degrees, so angle $ABC$ is 105 degrees (180 - 75). Therefore, angle $ADC$ is 123 degrees (360 - 62 - 75 - 105).\n            </think> <answer> 123 </answer>'

Problem: How many degrees are in the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 3:30?
Ground Truth: 75^\circ
Model Output: " At 3:30, the minute hand points at 6, and the hour hand is halfway between 3 and 4. The acute angle formed by these two hands is between 10 degrees and 20 degrees. To find the exact angle, we can consider the clock as a circle and divide it into 12 equal parts, each representing 30 degrees. At 3:30, the hour hand has moved 1/4 of the way to the next hour mark (from 3 to 4). Therefore, it has moved 30 degrees * (1/4) = 7.5 degrees from the 3 o'clock position. The minute hand is at 6, which is 180 degrees from the 12 o'clock position. To find the angle between the hour and minute hands, we need to consider the difference in their positions. The hour hand is at 7.5 degrees from the 3 o'clock position, and the minute hand is at 180 degrees from the 12 o'clock position. The acute angle formed by the hands is the difference between these two positions, which is 180 degrees - 7.5 degrees = 172.5 degrees.\n             </think> <answer> 172.5 degrees </answer>"

Model Output: ' [The user knows how to solve this problem. He solved the problem by applying the LCM concept of pairing the first digit with the 5th digit, the 2nd digit with the 4th digit and the 3rd digit cane can be anywhere. Since it is a five-digit palindrome, the 3rd digit will match with itself. Also, a number is divisible by 6 if it is the multiple of 2 and 3. Thus the 514415 in this case is divisible by 2 since it is odd and the 5 is in the unit place(1). Also, the number is a multiple of 3 (as the sum of digits 16 is a multiple of 3), the number is divisible by 6.]\n             </think> <answer>514215</answer>'

Problem: At the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.

How many handshakes are there in total?
Ground Truth: 162
Model Output: ' To calculate the number of handshakes:\n              - Counting handshakes within a team: Each team has 4 players, and each player shakes hands 4 times. So, each team has 4 * 4 = 16 handshakes.\n              - Counting handshakes between teams: Each player on one team shakes hands 3 times with each player on the opposing team. With a total of 3 players on the opposing team, each player would get 3 * 3 = 9 handshakes within a team. So, with 4 players on one team, it comes to 4 * 9 = 36 handshakes.\n              - Adding handshakes within and between teams: To get the final answer, we add the handshakes within a team and between teams.
